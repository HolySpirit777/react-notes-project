This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is only for me to test my skills in React and Javascript.

First run npm install inside directory, then run npm start to start the app.

You can create, erase, update notes and also add them to groups.

Notice that I am still working on this project and have much to fix and add...

There are not capital letters in this project, because for me it feels more natural to see letters only writen in lowercase.
