This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

First run npm install to install node_modules, then run npm start to run the app.

You can create, erase, update the notes, and also add them to groups.

Notice that I am still working on this project and have much to fix and add...

There are not capital letters in this project, because for me it feels more natural to see letters only writen in lowercase.
